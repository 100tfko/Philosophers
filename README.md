This project aims to teach concurrent programming, focusing on multithreading and multiprocessing.
</p>


## Key concepts:
<ul>
In this project, we must implement a classic problem and exercise: the dining philosophers, where philosophers sit at a table and must share cutlery. In programming concepts, this illustrates how processes must share resources without encountering issues like data races and race conditions.
</ul>

## Programming concepts:
<ul>
<li>Concurrent programming</li>
<li>Synchronization/li>
<li>Avoiding deadlocks</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
  </ul>

## Technologies:
<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>POSIX Threads (ptrheads)</li>
  <li>Makefile</li>
</ul>

## Skills:
<ul>
  <li>Rigor</li>
  <li>Imperative programming</li>
  <li>Unix</li>
</ul>

## Soft skills:
<ul>
  This project necessitates a good control over resource and project management. Since the code is heavily interconnected and share resources, it requires some higher level vision and patience to debug.
</ul>
